# An AngularJS module adapting underscore

This module exposes underscore's API into angular app's root scope,
and provides some filters from underscore.


## Filters

Whole Underscore's API for Collections, Arrays and Objects except decision API
(e.g. functions return true|false), side effect guys, and _.range(not make sense as a filter).
